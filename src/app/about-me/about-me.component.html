        <h5 class="education__header">Starting my career in law</h5>
        <p>
          I started working at Van Bruggen Attorneys right out of school and registered to study Bachelors of Commerce in Law the the University of South Africa. 
          I completed my degree during 2023 and registered to study the remainder of my Bachelors of Law (LLB) to become an attorney. 
          A few things that I have learned in this industry about myself - I enjoy research, a lot! Few things come close to the feeling of solving a problem after many hours of research. 
          I also found that I enjoy helping people. Though law can be challenging and fulfilling, it can also become very monotonomous.

          <p>
            I love learning new and challenging things. So at the start of 2024, I decided to dedicate my spare time to learning how to program, and what a journey this has been! I enrolled in a javascript course at Udemy and started coding away. 
            I soon realised that this was something that not only challenged me, but was what I wanted to dedicate the next part of my career to. 
            I recently attended a selection bootcamp and WeThinkCode_ which only semented this centiment. Not having a degree in software like many others in this field might set me back a bit, but this only spurs me on to work even harder.
            I also firmly believe that this drive to make it in this competitive industry is what I could bring to the table to any software firm.

          <p>
            Apart from programming which has become more than just a hobby for me, I also enjoy the Outdoors. I like camping, fishing, hunting and hiking. <br>
            I am also an avid chess player and enjoy participating on the Chess.com platform, where I am currently rated above 1600 ELO points. <br> 
            I enjoy watching movies - Christopher Nolan's are my favourite.
