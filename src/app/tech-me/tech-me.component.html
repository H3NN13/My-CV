        <h5 class="education__header">The Complete Javascript Course: From Zero to Expert</h5>
        <p>
          This is a Javascript course on Udemy by Jonas Schmedtmann, 
          It includes the following: 
          •	Built 5 beautiful real-world projects! In these projects, I learned how to plan and architect myapplications using flowcharts and common JavaScript patterns.<br>
          •	I learned JavaScript fundamentals: variables, if/else, operators, boolean logic, functions, arrays, objects, loops, strings, and more.<br>
          • I Learned modern JavaScript (ES6+) from the beginning: arrow functions, destructuring, spread operator, default arguments, optional chaining, and more.<br>
          •	I also learned How JavaScript works behind the scenes: engines, the call stack, hoisting, scoping, the 'this' keyword, reference values, and more.<br>
          •	Deep dive into functions: arrow functions, first-class and higher-order functions, bind, and closures.<br>
          •	Deep dive into object-oriented programming: prototypal inheritance, constructor functions (ES5), classes (ES6), encapsulation, abstraction, inheritance, and polymorphism. <br>
          •	Deep dive into asynchronous JavaScript: the event loop, promises, async/await, and error handling. You will use these to access data from third-party APIs with AJAX calls.  <br>
          •	Learn how to use some tools including: NPM, Parcel, Babel, and ES6 modules.<br>

          <h5 class="education__header">Angular Framework</h5>
          <p>
            After completing the abovementioned Javascript Course on udemy, I started exploring Angular ! Along with Angular I started learning TypeScript. 
            You might notice that this website was created using Angular !

              <p>
                From the 1st of July 2024 to 6th of July 2024, I had the opportunity to participate in WeThinkCode_'s selection bootcamp.
                This Bootcamp consisted of Python fundamentals. I thoroughly enjoyed using Python and found out that it is great for doing math in!

              <h5 class="education__header">Save Your Braai & Other Projects</h5>
              <p>
                Apart from the projects I built during the Javascript course, I also started some of my own ! 
                I am busy building an e-commerce site where users can save their braai by buying fire wood, ice and fire starters and get it delivered to them at their braai.
                At the moment, this site only has front-end developed and still needs back-end to make it fully functional. 
                Have a look  <a href="https://saveyourbraai.netlify.app" class="href"><span style = "   color: #007bff; font-weight:bold;">Save Your Braai</span></a>  and feel free to let me know if you have any suggested improvements.
              </p>
              <p>
                I'm also building a Ballisic Calculator which calculates the trajectory of a projectile fired from a firearm. 
                I love doing research and have done a tremendous amount to be able to calculate ballsitics accurately. I am working on creating an API which will handle the calculations,
                but for now I have not published this yet as I don't want my calculations to be seen by the user. I will happily however invite you on request to the github repository.
